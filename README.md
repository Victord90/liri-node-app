# liri-node-app

## Overview


In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.


## Instructions

To use this app clone the repository onto your computer and make sure to npm install all the dependencies to make sure the app works properly.
Once installed open your terminal and see the magic!

- Start by typing (node liri.js) for each function. After type the function.
- Try (movie-this "inception") This will show you info on the movie inception. Replace any inception with any movie you want, I used it as a starter point.
- Next try (concert-this "jonas brothers") This will show you the coming up concert info. Replace jonas brothers with any band you like.
- Then try (spotify-this-song "mama said knock you out") and find out basic info on the song. And of course you can replace that with any song you like.
- Finally try (do-what-it-says) and liri will read the random.txt file and display the info from that page.
